# Principles

## A list of ideas/things to follow when designing

(This isn't that serious of a list and is more just an idea of how design works here)

## Component categorization

Components are categorized into 3 sizes:

- large
- medium
- small

Large components are large page-defining components. Examples include:

- Hero elements
- Sidebars
- Large cards/information panels
- Page Sections

Medium components have similar use for larger elements, but are just smaller. Examples include:

- Header
- Smaller cards
- Modals/Dialogs
- Forms

Small components are your "atomic" elements, which are the bulk of content in the page. Examples include:

- Buttons
- Inputs
- Calendars
- Lists
- Avatar images
- Chips
- Basically 90% of your websites components

Each size has their own amount of shadow, rounding, padding, and more. Larger elements generally have more.
The amount of each should be consistent between components in the same size category, which is why you can only customize components generally and not per-item.
